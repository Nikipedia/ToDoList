# ToDoList
A simple drag-and-drop application to organize your day.

Create your own presets, give them custom colors and drag them into the day plan.

The application can be toggled by pressing Ctrl-Shift-X to allow for fast and easy access in comparison to other calendar apps.

It also tracks all your past day plans in an accessible way in a .txt file (see TaskTesting.txt) to allow for easy usage e.g. on https://app.rawgraphs.io/
